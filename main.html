							<h2>Objective</h2>
							George Griffith (1857–1906) was a British writer. He was active mainly in the science fiction genre, writing many future-war stories and helping to shape that emerging subgenre. He was briefly the leading science fiction author in Britain, making his breakthrough with his debut novel The Angel of the Revolution (1893), which was first serialized in Pearson's Weekly. He followed it up with the likewise successful sequel Olga Romanoff (1894). Griffith was highly active as a writer throughout the 1890s, penning many short works for C. Arthur Pearson, and went on travel assignments. These included an 1896 trip to Southern Africa that resulted in Griffith writing the novel Briton or Boer? (1897), anticipating the Boer War (1899–1902). Griffith's career declined in the late 1890s, and he was surpassed by H. G. Wells in the eyes of Pearson and the reading public. His last outright success was A Honeymoon in Space (1901). He continued to write prolifically up until his death at the age of 48.
